# InterpreterGit
A simple code interpreter I made for a class

-----CREDITS-----

The ADT folder and all the Interpreter, Lexical, QuadTable, SymbolTable, and Syntactic classes written and debugged mostly by me, Ryan Johnson
with a small start by my teacher Al Brouillette

Sample code and main files by Al

Written in Java using Eclipse

-----SYNTAX-----

simple  math (3 + x)*y/2;

variable assignment with x := anything;

while condition do
  begin
  statements;
end;

with < > = and <> being acceptable conditionals
no booleans, ands or ors

writeln("text or variable");

until condition do
  begin
  statements;
end;

total code should look like:

module Name;
begin

LOTS OF CODE

end.

-----USING THE INTERPRETER-----

Go to the Main.java class in src and give it the name of your file to read which should be located on the outside of the folder with all the other text files
